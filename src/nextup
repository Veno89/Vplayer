Code Quality Improvements
1. Error Handling & Recovery

Add retry logic for failed audio loads with exponential backoff
Implement graceful degradation when audio backend fails
Add error boundaries in React components to prevent full app crashes
Store failed track paths to skip on next scan
2. Performance Optimization

Implement virtualized lists for large libraries (already using react-window but could optimize further)
Debounce search input to reduce filtering operations
Memoize expensive computations in useLibrary filtering/sorting
Consider lazy loading album art thumbnails
Add pagination or infinite scroll for very large libraries
3. Code Organization

Extract magic numbers to constants file (e.g., volume step 0.1, seek threshold 3s)
Create separate constants for localStorage keys
Consider splitting VPlayer.jsx - it's 440+ lines and handles too much
Move window configurations to separate config file
4. Rust Backend

Implement proper error types instead of String errors
Add logging framework for better debugging
Consider using tokio for async operations in scanner
Add caching layer for metadata parsing (some audio files are slow to parse)
Implement incremental folder scanning (only scan changed files)
5. Testing

Add integration tests for Rust commands
Test edge cases: empty library, corrupted files, very long file paths
Add E2E tests using Tauri's testing framework
Test keyboard shortcuts thoroughly
6. Type Safety

Consider migrating to TypeScript for better type safety
Add JSDoc comments to all functions for better IDE support
Define prop types or use PropTypes library
