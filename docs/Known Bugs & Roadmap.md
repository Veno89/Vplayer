Known Bugs
-Set rating does not work in context menu or by clicking the stars in the platlist window.
-Player does not respect playlist tracks. It shuffles without the option on. When skipping to next song it jumps to a completely different one. 
It needs to ALWAYS respect the playlist window, regardless of what sorting option the user chooses.

Roadmap
-Add console log catcher with filtering and easy copy paste of both individual logs and all of them.
