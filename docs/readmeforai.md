## Important Guidance for AI Agents

- Enter Low Verbose Mode - Just do what you are told, no need to say wht you are doing or write summaries unless explicitly asked for by the user.
- When asked questions you may answer even if in Low Verbose Mode (however, still try to keep it concise).
- When asked a question or to discuss something, that means no code editing, only talking.
- Push to git with one command.
- Never push anything to git IF there are syntax errors in any of the files.
- When fixing syntax errors, try fixing the errors one at a time instead of creating a new file.
- The human developer is the play tester for this game. AI agents should NEVER run commands to test the game.
- Any commands that need to be executed must use proper PowerShell syntax.
- If unsure about any instructions or if context has been lost, ALWAYS ask the human developer before proceeding with any actions.
- Do not make assumptions about game behavior without verification from the human developer.


Adhere to the following programming principles when making additions/edits:
- SOLID, DRY, KISS, CoC, Composition over Inheritance, and the Law of Demeter.
