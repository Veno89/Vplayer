Code Quality Improvements
1. Performance Optimization
✅ Implement virtualized lists for large libraries (using react-window in PlaylistWindow)
Add pagination or infinite scroll for very large libraries (optional - virtualization sufficient)


2. Rust Backend
✅ Add logging framework for better debugging (using log crate with tauri-plugin-log)
✅ Consider using tokio for async operations in scanner (scan_folder already async with tokio runtime)
✅ Add caching layer for metadata parsing (tracks cached in database, skips failed files)
✅ Implement incremental folder scanning (scan_folder_incremental command with file_modified tracking)
